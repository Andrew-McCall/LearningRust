# Learning Rust

I wanted to learn rust; I'm a massive nerd.
Here are some of my first projects.

## Projects

### Conway's Game Of Life
# Description
My first program in rust.
A simple simulation created by John Conway. Pixels are either live or dead; Depending on their neighbour count they will spawn, survive, or die.

Key Libs:
- Piston_Window
- Rand
- *Time & Thread was used also*

### Future Improvements
May add editor so no random start
Refactor Code to be pretty after some more rust experience. 

### Notes

# Snake
## Description
Classic video game. The snake seeks apples, growing with each and will die/lose if the snake runs into itself or border. (Snake is controllable by player, This is the challange i'm learning - *still with piston_window*)

### Future Improvements
- Auto Restart on buttonpress (After death)
- circle apples
- speed on size
- Score / Win Condition
